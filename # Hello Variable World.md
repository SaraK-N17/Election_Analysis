# Hello Variable World

## Instructions


* Create two variables called `name` and `country` that will hold strings.
name = John
country = "United States"

* Create two variables called `age` and `hourly_wage` that will hold integers.
age = 40
hourly_wage = 15

* Create a variable called `satisfied` which will hold a boolean.
satisfied = True

* Create a variable called `daily_wage` that will hold the value of `hourly_wage` multiplied by 8.
daily_wage = hourly_wage * 8

* Use traditional string concatenation to print the `name`, `country`, `age`, and `hourly_wage` variables.
print("Hello " + name + "!")
print("You live in " + country)
print("You are " = str(age) + "years old")
print(f"You earned {daily_wage} per day.")



* With an `f-string`, print the `daily_wage` and `satisfied` variables.
print(f"Am I satisfied with my current wage? {satisfied}")
